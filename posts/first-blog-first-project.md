Programming Blog can be one of the best first projects for any programmer.

## Benefits

1. Document your entire journey and learning experience.
2. Keeps you accountable for learning.
3. Gives a level of professionalism.

## Following tips/suggestions for your programming blog

It is a personal choice, and based on what you are looking out of it when you spend your time creating a blog, you have the freedom to choose your platform/tech stack.

1. Reaching larger audience - use platforms like Medium, dev.to, hashnode.
2. Documenting your progress - anything works.

## My Motivation

1. Wanted to have a programming blog/website of my own for a long time.
2. Wanted to do 100 days of code.
3. [This short](https://youtube.com/shorts/Jm5s6N0R0pM?feature=share) was a recent trigger.

## My research before starting

- What tools/platform
- Any other things to keep in mind.
- YouTubed it - found some [suggestions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLFjOa-9UY) of using platforms like Medium or Hashnode for blogging.

- Amazon S3
- GitHub

### Use a static site generator

- Gatsby
- Hugo
- Jekyll
- Next.js

## What to write

- Doesn't have to be essay. Can be small tips tricks that I learn, on new tech maybe.
- Helps you remember and revisit what you learnt.

## All Set!

I decided to create a Next.js and Markdown based blog, because I really like Markdown and Next.js and wanted some hands-on with Next.js. More details in upcoming posts.

> **Update:** This blog was originally written in Markdown and published later on the now Live [blog](https://anant.vercel.app/)!
